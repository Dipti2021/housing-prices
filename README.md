## 📝 Overview

The California housing dataset contains information about housing districts in California derived from the 1990 U.S. census. The goal is to use this dataset to build a machine learning model that can predict the median housing price for each district. This README provides an overview of the project, including data preprocessing steps, model selection, evaluation metrics, and future improvements.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the California housing dataset, which includes the following features:

- MedInc: Median income of households in a district.
- HouseAge: Median house age in a district.
- AveRooms: Average number of rooms in a district.
- AveBedrms: Average number of bedrooms in a district.
- Population: Population of a district.
- AveOccup: Average occupancy per household in a district.
- Latitude: Latitude of a district.
- Longitude: Longitude of a district.

## 🛠️ Preprocessing

Before building the machine learning model, the dataset underwent preprocessing steps including handling missing values, feature scaling, and feature engineering.

## 🤖 Model Selection

Several machine learning algorithms were evaluated for their performance in predicting housing prices. The models considered include linear regression, decision trees, random forest, and support vector machine (SVM).

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics

The performance of each model was evaluated using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and R-squared score.

## 🔮 Future Improvements

Future improvements to the project may include exploring more advanced machine learning techniques, fine-tuning model hyperparameters, and collecting additional features that could improve the model's predictive accuracy.

## 🚀 Usage

To run the project:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies listed in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt).
3. Run the Jupyter notebook [housing.ipynb](housing.ipynb) to execute the code and train the machine learning model.
